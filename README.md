USER STORY

As a business owner, I want to create a website for my Pet Friendly Nursery Store. People can visit my website when they are planning to buy indoor plants and they want to know if their prospect plant is safe for their pet.

When planning to buy plants, sometimes pet owners initially donâ€™t consider if the plant they want to buy is safe for their pets. Furthermore, sometimes when a pet gets sick, veterinarians need as much information as possible to be able to help the animals. Users can also use my website to look for the plant they already have at home to see if the plant is pet friendly or if the plant had something to do with the pet being sick.

Buying a plant at our  pet friendly nursery shop guarantees a safe environment for your 
pet. In addition, we partner with SPCA so we can donate 50% of the sales when you buy a plant.
